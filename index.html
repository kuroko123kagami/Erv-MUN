        <h1>WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOL
<br>
<br>
Ecole Ruban Vert’s history dates back to 2013 when it began as a small school offering a unique blend of bilingual, internationally focused education to a small number of children. Since then the school has grown and is a leading institution offering a first class education from Foundation Stage to post-secondary level providing a progressive education with stability and continuity without the requirement to change schools periodically. Most recently, February 2020, ERV has secured full accreditation with the Council of International Schools, marking a significant stage in our development and recognition as an international school where best practice standards have been achieved.
<br>
<br>
<br>
We look back on our short history with pride and affection but we also look forward with eager anticipation to the challenge of meeting the educational needs of children growing up in the global village of the 21st century. We focus on sustainability as we offer a curriculum that is innovative and geared towards producing the kind of students’ universities and businesses are seeking.


            <br>
            <span id="name">A Scholarship programme provides local Gabonese students with access to top-class education alongside children from diverse backgrounds and cultures.
<br>
ERV students are recognised for their capacity to lead, to innovate, to impact and serve, to respect resources and the environment, and for making a significant impact on their school and their communities. We are now a fully functioning IB World School, offering PYP and DP curricula.</span>
        </h1>
        <h2> ERV is an education village that offers a holistic, structured, internationally minded education programme centred around the International Baccalaureate (IB) from 3 to 18 years. It includes the arts, literacy, maths, science, and humanities. The global economy which drives our nations requires students to be aware of other countries and cultures. We value talent and partnerships. Our actions are aligned with our mission, curriculum, campus and health and safety requirements.
<br>
ERV’s green state of the art, Batterie IV district, Libreville campus serves as the backdrop for an educational establishment that aims to facilitate creative and unorthodox thinking for Africa and for the future in general</h2>

            <div class="line">Welcome to the International School of Gabon Ruban Vert and thank you for your interest in our school.
 <br>
<br>
Everyone at ERV works hard to create an exciting, stimulating and innovative environment, to enable all our children to reach their full potential. All pupils are also expected to make their own contribution to school life. To achieve this, ERV has developed an Admission process which looks at the child’s current and potential academic ability as well as whether he/she will be happy in our environment.
<br>
At the point when a place is offered, the family’s financial background is not taken into account – the place is awarded on merit. Families who feel they may be eligible can apply for a means-tested bursary.
<br>
Please contact our Admissions office at admissions@ecolerubanvert.com if you are interested in applying to Ecole Ruban Vert. We will be happy to assist you during the entire online application process.</div>
